<h1>Muhe Yang</h1>

<div class="a">
	<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Information Studies at McGill University and a member of the ACT Research Group, supervised by Prof. Karyn Moffatt.</p>

	<p>I am a Human-Computer Interaction designer and researcher. My research goal is to design more accessible technologies for older adults and help them live healthier lives. My doctoral research aims to investigate how to better design health behavior change technology (i.e., persuasive technology) to support the needs of older adults living alone for physical activity. Recently, I presented a literature review on persuasive technology at GI’22.</p>

	<p>I am a trained designer, holding a MFA in Information Design and Visualization and a B.Eng in Industrial Design. My design works during my Master’s and undergraduate studies are shown in this portfolio.</p>
